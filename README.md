# FLAMES2Graph: An Interpretable Federated Multivariate Time Series Classification Framework

## Additional qualitative examples of the extracted subsequences and evolution graphs

In the examples below, we demonstrate additional cases by taking a closer look at the interpretability capacity and the effectiveness of our proposed FLAMES2Graph framework for the ECG (2-dimensional) and UWave(3-dimensional) datasets.
